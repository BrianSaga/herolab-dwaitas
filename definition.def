<!-- This is the definition file that provides the basis for everything else. All of
      the Skeleton data files contain examples of the most common behaviors you'll
      need and can be readily adapted to the game system you want to support. You'll
      find inline comments throughout all of the Skeleton data files that describe
      what is being done, as well as external documentation that outlines how
      everything is structured and how all the pieces fit together. A detailed
      example is also provided that outlines how to adapt these Skeleton data files
      for use with the Savage Worlds game system.
